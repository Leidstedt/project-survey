# Survey form with React
This project is part of the Technigo Bootcamp. The project is to use React to build a survey form. The completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.


## The problem
In this project I have focused on
-How to use form fields with React
-How to use `useState`
-How to use state to show different components based on where you are in the survey

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. 

### How did you plan? 
My planning was bad... I underestemated the time for the react coding and I had higher ambision regarding the design, right now it's just ulgly... 

### What technologies did you use? 
I used the useState hook in React and connected HTML form inputs to state. 

### If you had more time, what would be next?
The design...  and the checkboxes... They don't work right now so I need to spend more time to solve the problem. (I chose to not take them away since I think I'm close to solve it...)
